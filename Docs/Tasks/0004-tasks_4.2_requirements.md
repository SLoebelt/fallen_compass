# Week 4 – Expedition Loop & Bug Fixing

### Step 4.2: World Map & Expedition Planning System - additional requirements

_Goal: Implement a comprehensive map system for both Expedition Planning (Office) and Orientation (Overworld), meeting specific user requirements._

#### Map Funtionalities/Behavior

- Area Selection
- Start Point Selection within Area
- Risk (event probability) and Cost (money, provision/days) calculation based on selected Start Point
- Risk and Cost can be predefined in Data table for Start Points
- 3 fixed Start Points per Area
- Start Expedition button only enabled, if supplies and money are enough (currently only supplies implemented)
- map areas represent levels (whole map devided into a grid - level landscape is one grid)
- map grids are masked
- map areas get unveiled (fog of war on map - not in level itself - there sight is limited by the camera setting anyway) when travelling in Overworld
- route from office location (bottom center of map) to the start point via Splines or simple lines - boundaries predefined (coastlines on background map)
- every change made (selections) should be saved immediately, so the player can use escape and come back later
- on expedition start the selections are restored
