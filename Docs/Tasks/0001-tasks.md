## Week 1 – Project Skeleton & First-Person Office Basics

> Naming: All custom classes use the **FC** prefix (e.g. `UFCGameInstance`, `AFCGameMode`, `AFCFirstPersonCharacter`).  
> Primary platform: **Windows**, Linux/macOS enabled but only tested at phase ends.

### 1.0 Create Unreal Engine 5.7 C++ project and configure Git

- [x] **1.1 Review project documents**

  - [x] Open `/Docs/UE_NamingConventions.md` and note:
    - [x] Required folder structure (e.g. `/Source/FC`, `/Content/FC`).
    - [x] Class naming rules (FC prefix).
  - [x] Skim `/Docs/Fallen_Compass_GDD_v0.2.md` for high-level context of office & perspective.
  - [x] Skim `/Docs/Fallen_Compass_DRM.md` for Week 1 goals.

- [x] **1.2 Create Unreal C++ project**

  - [x] Initialize Git in the project root.
  - [x] Add a UE-focused `.gitignore` (exclude `Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`, `DerivedDataCache/`, most of `Saved/`).
  - [x] Ensure large auto-generated files and caches are ignored.

- [x] **1.5 Create README & branching conventions**
  - [x] Create `/README.md` with:
    - [x] Short project description ("Fallen Compass").
    - [x] Engine version (UE 5.7).
    - [x] Branching strategy (e.g., `master` + `feature/<name>`).

### 2.0 Implement core FC framework classes (GameInstance, GameMode, PlayerController)

- [x] **2.1 Create custom GameInstance class**

  - [x] In C++, create `UFCGameInstance` derived from `UGameInstance`.
  - [x] Register `UFCGameInstance` in Project Settings → Maps & Modes → Game Instance Class.
  - [x] Add placeholder fields/comments for future global data (e.g. current expedition, settings).

- [x] **2.2 Create custom GameMode class**

  - [x] Create `AFCGameMode` derived from `AGameModeBase`.
  - [x] Configure it as the default GameMode for the Office level (later, once Office level exists).
  - [x] Add basic logging in `BeginPlay()` to confirm it's being used.

- [x] **2.3 Create custom PlayerController class**

  - [x] Create `AFCPlayerController` derived from `APlayerController`.
  - [x] Set it as the default PlayerController Class in `AFCGameMode`.
  - [x] Add empty stubs / placeholders for:
    - [x] Handling interaction input.
    - [x] Handling ESC/pause menu logic.
    - [x] Managing camera state (first-person vs table-view).

- [x] **2.4 Verify framework wiring**
  - [x] Launch project in a simple test level using `AFCGameMode` and `AFCPlayerController`.
  - [x] Confirm via logs or debugger that:
    - [x] `UFCGameInstance` is constructed.
    - [x] `AFCGameMode` and `AFCPlayerController` are active.

---

### 3.0 Implement first-person character pawn with input mappings (movement, look, interact, ESC)

- [x] **3.1 Create first-person character class**

  - [x] Create `AFCFirstPersonCharacter` derived from `ACharacter`.
  - [x] Add a camera component as a child of the character (for first-person view).
  - [x] Optionally add a basic mesh/arms or placeholder component (not required in Week 1).

- [x] **3.2 Configure input mappings**

  - [x] In Project Settings → Input, configure:
    - [x] Axis mappings:
      - [x] `MoveForward` (W = +1, S = -1).
      - [x] `MoveRight` (D = +1, A = -1).
      - [x] `Look` (Mouse 2dAxis).
    - [x] Action mappings:
      - [x] `Interact` (e.g. E key).
      - [x] `Pause` (ESC key).
  - [x] Save and verify no Input mapping conflicts.

- [x] **3.3 Implement movement & look in character**

  - [x] In `AFCFirstPersonCharacter`, bind Axis and Action mappings in `SetupPlayerInputComponent`.
  - [x] Implement:
    - [x] Forward/backward movement for `MoveForward`.
    - [x] Right/left movement for `MoveRight`.
    - [x] Yaw rotation for `Turn`.
    - [x] Pitch rotation for `LookUp`.
  - [x] Ensure the camera rotates with the character and feels like a standard FPS.

- [x] **3.4 Connect character to GameMode**

  - [x] Set `AFCFirstPersonCharacter` as the **Default Pawn Class** in `AFCGameMode`.
  - [x] Launch PIE and confirm that the player spawns as `AFCFirstPersonCharacter`.

- [x] **3.5 Expose hooks for interaction and ESC**
  - [x] In `AFCFirstPersonCharacter` or `AFCPlayerController`:
    - [x] Bind `Interact` action to a function that will later call interactables (e.g. trace forward).
    - [x] Bind `Pause` action (ESC) to a function that will delegate pause/menu handling (eventually to controller/UI).

  - [x] Name it clearly (e.g. `SM_Table_Office` or `BP_OfficeTable`).
  - [x] Ensure it's reachable by walking.

- [x] **4.4 Add placeholder door prop**

  - [x] Add a door mesh or placeholder rectangle to represent the exit door.
  - [x] Name it clearly (e.g. `SM_OfficeDoor` or `BP_OfficeDoor`).
  - [x] Place it on one wall in a position that is clearly an "exit".

- [x] **4.5 Set up camera positions for table view**

  - [x] Create a target transform for the **table-focused camera view**:
    - [x] Either place a `Camera` actor pointing at the table, or define a `SceneComponent` on the table blueprint that acts as camera target.
  - [x] Verify that from this transform, the table is clearly visible and framed.

- [x] **4.6 Basic lighting & navigation**
  - [x] Add at least one light so the room is visible (sun light from outdoor for now).
  - [x] Ensure character movement navigates correctly in the room.
  - [x] Quick test: run PIE, walk around, ensure scale and movement feel okay.

### 6.0 Implement in-game Office flow (table camera, ESC behaviour, pause menu, door → Main Menu)

> **Architecture**: Follow separation of concerns — PlayerController delegates to UIManager for UI logic; actor interaction uses a C++ BlueprintNativeEvent interface `IFCInteractable` and a character-attached `UFCInteractionComponent` (UE_CodeConventions.md §2.3, §5.1).

---

#### Step 6.1: Use C++ Interaction Interface and Component

##### Step 6.1.1: Confirm IFCInteractable C++ Interface

- [x] **Analysis**

  - [x] What implementations already exist: Check technical documentation (`/Docs/TechnicalDocumentation/FCRuntime.md and linked files`) and project file system (`/FC/*`)

- [x] **Implementation**
  - [x] Verify C++ interface exists at `/FC/Source/FC/Interaction/IFCInteractable.h` (already present)
  - [x] Confirm functions are declared as `BlueprintNativeEvent`:
    - [x] `OnInteract(AActor* Interactor)`
    - [x] `FText GetInteractionPrompt() const`
    - [x] `bool CanInteract(AActor* Interactor) const`
    - [x] `float GetInteractionRange() const`
    - [x] `int32 GetInteractionPriority() const`
  - [x] Confirm `UINTERFACE(Blueprintable)` on `UIFCInteractable` and that Blueprints can implement it
  - [x] In a Blueprint (e.g., `BP_MenuDoor`), open Class Settings → Interfaces and verify `IFCInteractable` appears and can be added
  - [x] Compile
- [x] **Testing After Step 6.1.1**
  - [x] PIE starts successfully without crashes
  - [x] Interface visible in Blueprint class settings "Implemented Interfaces" list
  - [x] No compile errors in Blueprint editor
  - [x] Main menu still functions correctly
  - [x] Can walk around office with WASD + mouse

##### Step 6.1.2: Verify UFCInteractionComponent and Input Routing

- [x] **Analysis**

  - [x] What implementations already exist: Check technical documentation and project file system

- [x] **Implementation (Character & Controller)**

  - [x] Confirm `UFCInteractionComponent` is attached to `AFCFirstPersonCharacter` and initialized (see Technical_Documentation.md → Office Flow & Interactions)
  - [x] Verify key properties on the component:
    - [x] `InteractionTraceDistance` (e.g., 500.0f)
    - [x] `InteractionCheckFrequency` (e.g., 0.1f)
    - [x] `bShowDebugTrace` (enable temporarily for debugging)
  - [x] Verify input routing: `AFCPlayerController::HandleInteractPressed()` delegates to the character’s `InteractionComponent->Interact()`
  - [x] Ensure the component performs the line trace and calls `IIFCInteractable::Execute_OnInteract(...)` on the focused actor
  - [x] Compile successfully (Live Coding or manual rebuild)

- [x] **Testing After Step 6.1.2**
  - [x] PIE starts successfully without crashes
  - [x] Main menu appears correctly
  - [x] "New Legacy" transitions to gameplay
  - [x] Can walk around office with WASD + mouse
  - [x] Press E (Interact key) - no crashes (nothing implements interface yet)
  - [x] No errors in Output Log
  - [x] No "Accessed None" Blueprint errors

---

#### Step 6.2: Implement Table View Interaction

##### Step 6.2.1: Add IFCInteractable to BP_OfficeDesk

- [x] **Analysis**

  - [x] Verify `BP_OfficeDesk` exists at `/Game/FC/World/Blueprints/BP_OfficeDesk`
  - [x] Confirm it has `CameraTargetPoint` SceneComponent (already present)
  - [x] Check Technical_Documentation.md §4.3 for current setup

- [x] **Implementation**
  - [x] Open Blueprint: `/Content/FC/World/Blueprints/BP_OfficeDesk.uasset`
  - [x] Add Interface: Class Settings → Interfaces → Click "Add" → Select `IFCInteractable` (C++ interface, Blueprint-implementable)
  - [x] Implement `OnInteract` event:
    - [x] Event Graph → Right-click → "Add Event" → "Event On Interact"
    - [x] Cast `Interactor` to `AFCFirstPersonCharacter`
    - [x] Get Controller → Cast to `AFCPlayerController`
    - [x] Call `SetCameraMode(TableView)`
  - [x] Implement `GetInteractionPrompt` function:
    - [x] Event Graph → Right-click → "Add Function" → "Get Interaction Prompt"
    - [x] Return FText: "Press E to view table"
  - [x] Implement `CanInteract` function:
    - [x] Event Graph → Right-click → "Add Function" → "Can Interact"
    - [x] Return Value: true (always allow interaction)
  - [x] Compile and save Blueprint
- [x] **Verify Placement**
  - [x] Open L_Office level
  - [x] Confirm `BP_OfficeDesk` is placed (already present from Task 4)
  - [x] Verify collision is enabled on Static Mesh Component
  - [x] Check distance from player spawn (within ~500 units)
  - [x] Save level if changes made
- [x] **Testing After Step 6.2.1**
  - [x] PIE starts successfully
  - [x] Walk up to desk
  - [x] Interaction prompt appears: "Press E to view table"
  - [x] Press E → camera blends to table view using CameraTargetPoint (smooth 2s transition)
  - [x] Movement inputs disabled in table view
  - [x] ESC currently returns to main menu (expected - Step 6.3 will fix)
  - [x] No crashes or errors
  - [x] Check Output Log for interaction logs (LogFCInteraction category)

##### Step 6.2.2: Add bIsInTableView State to PlayerController

- [x] **Analysis**

  - [x] What implementations already exist: Check technical documentation and project file system

- [x] **Implementation (FCPlayerController.h)**
  - [x] Add protected property:
    ```cpp
    protected:
        /** Tracks whether player is currently in table view mode */
        UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Camera")
        bool bIsInTableView = false;
    ```
  - [x] Update `SetCameraMode()` signature (renamed from `SetFallenCompassCameraMode()`)
- [x] **Implementation (FCPlayerController.cpp)**

  - [x] Created `SetCameraModeLocal()` helper method with smooth camera blending logic
  - [x] Implemented table view camera system:
    - [x] Spawns temporary `ACameraActor` at `BP_OfficeDesk::CameraTargetPoint` transform
    - [x] Uses component world transform (location + rotation) for accurate camera positioning
    - [x] 2-second cubic blend to table view camera
    - [x] Switches input mapping from `FirstPersonMappingContext` to `StaticSceneMappingContext`
    - [x] `StaticSceneMappingContext` allows UI inputs (ESC) but blocks movement (WASD, mouse look)
  - [x] Implemented first-person return from table view:
    - [x] Blends back to pawn camera over 2 seconds (cubic interpolation)
    - [x] Delays cleanup of temporary camera actor until after blend completes (BlendTime + 0.1s)
    - [x] Restores `FirstPersonMappingContext` immediately for responsive controls
    - [x] Uses `ClearAllMappings()` before adding context to ensure clean switching
  - [x] Compile successfully

- [x] **Testing After Step 6.2.2**
  - [x] PIE starts successfully
  - [x] Interact with table → camera blends smoothly to table view (2s cubic)
  - [x] Camera rotation correctly matches CameraTargetPoint orientation
  - [x] WASD keys disabled (no movement)
  - [x] Mouse look disabled
  - [x] ESC transitions smoothly back to first-person (2s cubic blend)
  - [x] Movement restored immediately after ESC press
  - [x] No crashes or errors

**Implementation Details:**

- **Camera System**: Uses temporary `ACameraActor` spawned at runtime to avoid Blueprint dependencies
- **Input Mapping Strategy**: Three contexts used:
  - `FirstPersonMappingContext`: Full movement + ESC (gameplay)
  - `StaticSceneMappingContext`: ESC only (table view, cutscenes)
  - `MainMenuMappingContext`: UI-only (menu state)
- **Blend Timing**: Consistent 2.0s cubic blend for all camera transitions (smooth, cinematic feel)
- **Cleanup Strategy**: Timer-delayed actor destruction prevents blend interruption

---

#### Step 6.3: Implement ESC from Table View

- [x] **Analysis**

  - [x] What implementations already exist: Checked technical documentation and project file system

- [x] **Implementation - Input Consolidation**

  - [x] Consolidated ESC key handling to single `IA_Escape` input action
  - [x] Removed duplicate `IA_Pause` action (was conflicting with PIE shutdown)
  - [x] Updated `FCPlayerController`:
    - [x] Removed `PauseAction` property
    - [x] Removed `UIEscapeAction` property
    - [x] Added single `EscapeAction` property (loads `/Game/FC/Input/IA_Escape`)
  - [x] Configured `IMC_FC_StaticScene` mapping context:
    - [x] Added `IA_Escape` → Keyboard Escape key
    - [x] Removed `IA_Pause` from this context (unified ESC handling)
    - [x] Verified no movement inputs (WASD, Mouse) are mapped

- [x] **Implementation - Context-Aware ESC Handler (FCPlayerController.cpp)**

  - [x] Rewrote `HandlePausePressed()` with state awareness:

    ```cpp
    void AFCPlayerController::HandlePausePressed()
    {
        // If in table view, ESC exits back to first-person
        if (CameraMode == EFCPlayerCameraMode::TableView)
        {
            SetCameraModeLocal(EFCPlayerCameraMode::FirstPerson, 2.0f);
            return;
        }

        // If in gameplay state, ESC toggles pause menu
        if (CurrentGameState == EFCGameState::Gameplay)
        {
            UFCUIManager* UIManager = ...;
            if (bIsPauseMenuDisplayed)
            {
                UIManager->HidePauseMenu();
                bIsPauseMenuDisplayed = false;
            }
            else
            {
                UIManager->ShowPauseMenu();
                bIsPauseMenuDisplayed = true;
            }
            return;
        }

        // In main menu or other UI states, ESC does nothing
    }
    ```

  - [x] Updated `SetCameraModeLocal()` FirstPerson case:
    - [x] Uses `ClearAllMappings()` + `AddMappingContext(FirstPersonMappingContext)` for clean switching
    - [x] Delays temporary camera cleanup until after blend (BlendTime + 0.1s timer)
    - [x] Restores input immediately for responsive controls
  - [x] Compile successfully

- [x] **Implementation - PIE Shutdown Key Rebinding**

  - [x] Manually rebound PIE "Stop Play Session" from ESC to F10 in Editor Preferences
  - [x] This allows ESC to be used for in-game functionality without quitting PIE

- [x] **Testing After Step 6.3**
  - [x] PIE starts successfully
  - [x] Interact with table → camera blends to table view (2s smooth)
  - [x] Press ESC → camera smoothly blends back to first-person (2s)
  - [x] Movement and mouse look re-enabled immediately
  - [x] Press ESC from first-person → pause menu appears (Step 6.4)
  - [x] ESC toggles pause menu on/off correctly
  - [x] No crashes or errors

**Technical Notes:**

- **Input Action Consolidation**: Single `IA_Escape` replaces `IA_Pause` + `IA_UIEscape` for cleaner input architecture
- **State-Driven Behavior**: `HandlePausePressed()` checks `CameraMode` and `CurrentGameState` to determine ESC action
- **Mapping Context Strategy**:
  - `FirstPersonMappingContext`: Full controls (WASD, mouse, ESC, interact, F5/F9)
  - `StaticSceneMappingContext`: ESC only (blocks movement during table view)
  - `MainMenuMappingContext`: UI-only (menu state)
- **PIE Workflow**: ESC now fully dedicated to game logic; F10 stops PIE session

#### Step 6.4: Implement Pause Menu from First-Person

##### Step 6.4.1: Create WBP_PauseMenu Widget

- [x] **Analysis**

  - [x] What implementations already exist: Check technical documentation and project file system

- [x] **Implementation**
  - [x] Create UMG widget at `/Game/FC/UI/Menus/WBP_PauseMenu`
  - [x] Add Canvas Panel with centered Vertical Box
  - [x] Add semi-transparent background overlay (50% black)
  - [x] Add title text: "Paused" (large font, white)
  - [x] Add vertical button container with buttons:
    - [x] "Resume" → calls `AFCPlayerController::ResumeGame()`
    - [x] "Settings" → placeholder (disabled for now)
    - [x] "Back to Main Menu" → calls `AFCPlayerController::ReturnToMainMenu()`
    - [x] "Quit to Desktop" → calls `AFCPlayerController::QuitGame()`
  - [x] Apply button hover effects (scale 1.1, highlight color)
  - [x] Compile and save widget
- [x] **Blueprint Configuration (BP_FC_GameInstance)**
  - [x] Add variable `PauseMenuClass` (TSubclassOf<UUserWidget>)
  - [x] Set default value to `WBP_PauseMenu`
  - [x] Compile Blueprint
- [x] **Testing After Step 6.4.1**
  - [x] Widget compiles without errors
  - [x] Buttons visible and styled correctly in widget preview
  - [x] GameInstance Blueprint compiles successfully
  - [x] PIE starts without crashes

##### Step 6.4.2: Implement Pause Logic in UIManager

- [x] **Analysis**

  - [x] What implementations already exist: Check technical documentation and project file system

- [x] **Implementation (FCUIManager.h)**

  - [x] Add public methods:

    ```cpp
    public:
        /** Shows pause menu and pauses game */
        UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "UI")
        void ShowPauseMenu();

        /** Hides pause menu and resumes game */
        UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "UI")
        void HidePauseMenu();

    protected:
        /** Cached pause menu widget instance */
        UPROPERTY()
        UUserWidget* PauseMenuWidget = nullptr;
    ```

- [x] **Implementation (FCUIManager.cpp)**

  - [x] Implement `ShowPauseMenu()`
  - [x] Implement `HidePauseMenu()`
  - [x] Compile successfully

- [x] **Testing After Step 6.4.2**
  - [x] Compile succeeds without errors
  - [x] PIE starts successfully
  - [x] Can walk around office

##### Step 6.4.3: Connect Pause Menu to PlayerController

- [x] **Implementation**

  - [x] Added `ResumeGame()` method to `AFCPlayerController`
  - [x] Updated `HandlePausePressed()` to call `UIManager->ShowPauseMenu()` / `HidePauseMenu()`
  - [x] Updated `ReturnToMainMenu()` to hide pause menu before transition
  - [x] Fixed timer issue: pause menu now unpauses before setting level reload timer

- [x] **Testing After Step 6.4.3** ✅ CRITICAL TEST POINT
  - [x] PIE starts successfully
  - [x] Walk around in first-person
  - [x] Press ESC → pause menu appears, game pauses, mouse visible
  - [x] Click "Resume" → menu closes, game unpauses, mouse hidden, movement restored
  - [x] Press ESC again → pause menu reappears
  - [x] Press ESC → pause menu appears
  - [x] Click "Back to Main Menu" → fades to black, returns to menu
  - [x] Click "Quit to Desktop" → game quits
  - [x] No crashes or errors

---

##### Step 6.4.4: Implement Quit to Desktop (COMPLETED - Already working)

- [x] **Analysis**

  - [x] What implementations already exist: Check technical documentation and project file system

- [x] **Implementation (FCPlayerController.h)**
  - [x] Add public method:
    ```cpp
    /** Quits the game application */
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "Game")
    void QuitGame();
    ```
- [x] **Implementation (FCPlayerController.cpp)**
  - [x] Implement `QuitGame()`:
    ```cpp
    void AFCPlayerController::QuitGame()
    {
        UKismetSystemLibrary::QuitGame(GetWorld(), this, EQuitPreference::Quit, false);
    }
    ```
- [x] **Blueprint Configuration (WBP_PauseMenu)**
  - [x] Update "Quit to Desktop" button binding:
    - [x] On Clicked → Get Player Controller → Cast to FC Player Controller → Call `QuitGame()`
  - [x] Compile and save widget
- [x] **Testing After Step 6.4.4**
  - [x] PIE starts successfully
  - [x] Open pause menu (ESC from gameplay)
  - [x] Click "Quit to Desktop" → PIE session ends cleanly (or editor prompts to stop)
  - [x] No crashes or errors during shutdown

---

#### Step 6.5: Door Interaction Implementation (Already Complete)

- [x] **Status**: Door interaction already implemented in Task 5.5
  - [x] `BP_OfficeDoor` implements `IFCInteractable`
  - [x] Calls `AFCPlayerController::ReturnToMainMenu()`
  - [x] Fades to black and reloads L_Office in menu state
  - [x] No changes needed

---

#### Step 6.6: State Sanity Checks and Final Verification

- [x] **Full Flow Testing**
  - [x] Start game → Main menu appears
  - [x] Click "New Legacy" → Office gameplay
  - [x] Walk to table → Press E → Table view
  - [x] Press ESC → First-person restored
  - [x] Press ESC → Pause menu
  - [x] Click "Resume" → Gameplay restored
  - [x] Press ESC → Pause menu
  - [x] Click "Back to Main Menu" → Fade → Menu state
  - [x] Click "New Legacy" → Gameplay
  - [x] Press ESC → Pause menu
  - [x] Click "Quit to Desktop" → Clean exit
- [x] **Edge Case Testing**
  - [x] Rapid ESC presses don't break state
  - [x] Pause menu buttons don't respond to multiple clicks (idempotent)
  - [x] Table interaction while paused → no effect (expected)
  - [x] Door interaction from table view → works correctly
- [x] **Code Conventions Compliance Check**
  - [x] All `UObject*` pointers use `UPROPERTY()` for GC tracking ✅
  - [x] PlayerController delegates to UIManager (separation of concerns) ✅
  - [x] Interaction uses `IFCInteractable` C++ interface (BlueprintNativeEvent) and `UFCInteractionComponent` (loose coupling) ✅
  - [x] State changes logged for debugging
  - [x] No excessive Tick usage (event-driven design) ✅

**COMMIT POINT 6.6**: `git add -A && git commit -m "test: Verify all office flow states and transitions"`
