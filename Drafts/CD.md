Ohhh, **Slomotion / SLO-Motion** is a fun direction. It’s got personality and works really well for games & CGI.

I’ll design a concept assuming the studio does **games, CGI, cinematics, motion design & 3D**.

---

## 1. Name & brand story

### Name variants

- **Primary name (recommended):** **Slomotion Studio**
- **Logo wordmark:** **Slomotion**
- **Optional stylized form:** **SLOmotion** (subtle nod to your initials).

I’d avoid the dash (“SLO-Motion”) in the logo itself – it’s harder to handle typographically and less clean in URLs – but you can still use “SLO-Motion” in text occasionally if you like.

### Meaning / positioning

- _Slow motion_ → focus on **detail, emotion, and crafted moments**, not throwaway content.
- **SLO** → your initials; it secretly stands for _Steffen Loebelt Originals_ if anyone asks.
- Brand story:

  > _Slomotion Studio freezes the most intense moments of a world, studies them, and then turns them into interactive experiences and cinematic imagery._

Tagline ideas:

- **“Slow the moment. Shape the world.”**
- **“Where every frame matters.”**
- **“Time-stretched worlds, handcrafted.”**

## 2. Logo concept

### 2.1 Core idea

A **wordmark + subtle symbol** that hints at time and motion:

- **Wordmark:** _Slomotion_ in a custom-ish type treatment:

  - “Slo” slightly heavier; “motion” a bit lighter → visually echoes speed vs calm.
  - A subtle ligature or connection between **“m” and “o”** to create a smooth flow.

- **Symbol (icon):**

  - A **circular “shutter / time ring”** made of 3–4 segments, one segment slightly offset, suggesting:

    - a slowed frame,
    - an aperture,
    - or a rotating disc frozen in motion.

  - This ring can sit:

    - before the word,
    - or as the **“o”** in “motion”.

It should work:

- in 1 color and inverted,
- tiny (social avatar, taskbar icon),
- as a stand-alone “SLO disc” icon.

## 3. Color palette

We want **cinematic + techy**, but not generic neon gamer brand.

**Primary**

- **Midnight Navy** – `#101623`
  Base background, looks great with CG renders.
- **Signal Cyan** – `#3FD4D1`
  Accent for highlight strokes, UI, tiny glows.

**Secondary**

- **Deep Indigo** – `#1C2340` – panels, gradients.
- **Soft Violet** – `#6D6FD8` – light accent for gradients with cyan.

**Neutrals**

- **Fog Grey** – `#C5CED8` – body text on dark.
- **Off White** – `#F4F5F8` – for bright documents, print, decks.

**Usage idea**

- Background: Midnight Navy → gradient to Deep Indigo.
- Logo: white or Fog Grey, with a **single cyan stroke or segment** in the time ring.

## 4. Typography

### Display / Logo style

- A **clean geometric or humanist sans** with some character in the round letters.
  Inspirations:

  - _Satoshi, Plus Jakarta Sans, Avenir Next_-like.

- Custom tweak:

  - Slight tracking.
  - Rounded corners or soft terminals to prevent it from feeling too cold.

### Body / UI

- Same family or similar modern sans (e.g. _Inter_ or _Nunito_).
- Use **light → regular → medium** weights for hierarchy, avoid too many styles.

**Rules**

- LOGO / big titles: all caps or “Slomotion” title case.
- Never overdo effects – keep it readable over dark imagery.

## 5. Brand imagery & motion style

This brand name begs for **motion language**, even in static art.

### Visual style

- **Cinematic keyframes**: dramatic lighting, strong contrast, focus on silhouettes & micro-detail.
- **Moment-focused composition**:

  - Freeze **1–2 seconds before or after impact**:
    a sword almost connecting, a creature emerging from fog, a convoy on the ridge before the storm.

- Works with your medieval / expedition themes, but also with future projects.

### Motion language (for showreels / intros)

- Slow, deliberate camera moves.
- Time-based effects:

  - **stuttered motion trails**,
  - particles whose movement slows at logo reveal,
  - UI elements emerging as if time is being scrubbed.

Example intro:

1. A scene in normal speed (convoy, campfire, city).
2. Time slows—sparks hang in the air, cloth movement eases.
3. Camera pushes in; the scene desaturates slightly.
4. The **Slomotion** logo fades in, with the time ring rotating once then “clicking” into place.

## 6. Applications

### Website hero

- Dark gradient background with a big **hero render** (game scene or 3D concept).
- Left side:

  - LOGO
  - Tagline: “Where every frame matters.”
  - CTA: “Watch Showreel” (cyan button).

### Social / launcher

- **Avatar:** just the time ring icon in cyan on navy.
- **Banner:** montage of your art with a blurred motion streak cutting through, logo on one side.

### Document / pitch deck

- Cover: navy → indigo gradient, logo centered, small cyan underline.
- Inside: plenty of negative space, big stills cropped to focus on emotional beats.

## 7. How it sits next to _SLO Forge_

Quick comparison so you can feel which fits you more long-term:

- **SLO Forge** → craftsmanship, worlds, a bit “fantasy / workshop / forge of ideas”.
- **Slomotion** → cinematic, time, showreels, animation, feels very **CGI / motion design**.

If you imagine doing a lot of **cinematics, trailers, 3D reels**, _Slomotion Studio_ is strong.
If you want a **worldbuilding / IP house** that might one day have multiple sub-labels, _SLO Forge_ might be the “parent”.

If you tell me which one you lean toward for your actual company name, I can write you:

- a short **brand manifesto** text,
- a **tone-of-voice guide** (how SLO writes tweets, website copy, etc.),
- and a one-page brief you can hand to a designer to build the actual logo & templates.
